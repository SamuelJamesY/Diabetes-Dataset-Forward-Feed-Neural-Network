# Diabetes-Dataset-Forward-Feed-Neural-Network

Numpy, pandas and sklearn were used to develop two neural network models for the Pima Indian diabetes dataset; one using an Adam optimiser 
and one using an SGD optimiser. 
  The effect of hyperparameter tuning was explored with respect to hidden node
  quantities in each hidden layer. Ten different hidden node sizes were considered ranging from 6 to 26 per layer.
  For each hidden node quantity 10 experiments were considered and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. 
  A comparison was then made as to which hidden node quantity resulted in the highest mean and standard deviation
  classification accuracy score.
